# ðŸ”— Fetch API -  Dynamic Content Loading

This project demonstrates how to use the **Fetch API** to dynamically load the content of HTML pages without having to reload the entire page.

The main goal is to demonstrate efficient and simple navigation with asynchronous requests (**AJAX**).

## ðŸ“Œ About the project


The project consists of a main page (`index.html`) with links that load additional HTML content (`page1.html`, `page2.html`, and `page3.html`). When clicking on the links, the content of these pages is loaded via the Fetch API directly on the main page, inside a specific element (`<div>`).
